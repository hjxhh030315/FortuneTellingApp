# Experimental Team Meeting 1 Notes
### Time
> 4/20 4-5pm PST, Remote (Zoom)
#### Attendees
Chris, Eric, Jessica, Ryan (note taker)

## Notes
- Goal of team should be to generate AI code and test new tools
- Considered Netlify, but Github Pages is probably enough
- Code for 8-ball was generated, and it works
- Considered getting it to Github Pages but since no repo existed there was a barrier to doing so
- Possibility of using databases/Firebase in future projects
- Limited uses for 8-ball, and it’s heavy compared to what we want to do.
- Jessica will present AI-generated code/communicate with Nikan
- Eric will test Firebase if he has time - scrapped
