		- Does not have to affect the reading
		- Readings have to encompass all answers to the questions.
		- Verdict: finish AFTER implementing Figma prototype.
	- ??Have a stack/spread of cards and pick 3??
- This would be the normal way; however, we have to contend with the fact that there’s 78 cards.
	- Show 3 at a time, pick 1 from each(3 sets of 3)
- Allow user to “shuffle” cards and pick 1
- Have a massive scrolling selection of cards
- stress testing
